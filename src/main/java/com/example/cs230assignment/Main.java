 * Sample application that demonstrates the use of JavaFX Canvas for a Game.

 * how to draw an image on a canvas, respond to arrow key presses, use a tick method that is
 * called periodically, and use drag and drop.
 * 
 * Do not build the whole application in one file. This file should probably remain very small.
